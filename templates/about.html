              This project allows users to track Google Trends feeds at the daily level for periods longer than 3 months, and even at the minute level for periods longer than one day. While Google allows downloads of CSVs for these lookback periods, we continue to track and merge these sets over time to provide more granularity to these fascinating datasets. Feel free to contact me on my personal website for any inquiries into this open-source service.
